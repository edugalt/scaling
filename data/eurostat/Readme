The data is from here:
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/cities/data/database

It includes data on european metropolitan areas regarding:
- population
- culture (e.g. number of theaters)
- 'all companies' (is this the number of companies?)

The tables `EUROSTAT_*` were constructed by merging the different tables.
